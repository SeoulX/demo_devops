2. Go to: **http://jenkins.local**

### Step 2: Create New Job
1. Click **"New Item"** button (top left of dashboard)
   - OR click **"Create a job"** link

### Step 3: Configure Job Name and Type
1. **Job Name**: Type `demo_devops`

   - Make sure it's "Pipeline", NOT "Freestyle project"
3. Click **"OK"** button

You'll see a configuration page. Scroll down and find **"Pipeline"** section:

#### In "Pipeline" Section:

1. **Pipeline Definition** (dropdown):
   - Select: **"Pipeline script from SCM"**
   - This tells Jenkins to read your Jenkinsfile from GitHub

2. **SCM** (dropdown below):
   - Select: **"Git"**

3. **Repository Configuration**:
   - **Repository URL**: 
     ```
     https://github.com/SeoulX/demo_devops.git
     ```
   - **Credentials**: 
     - Click the dropdown, select: **`demo-app-git`**
     - If not visible, click "Add" button and add your GitHub credentials
   
   - **Branch Specifier**: 
     ```
     */main
     ```
     - Or just type: `main`
   
   - **Script Path**: 
     ```
     Jenkinsfile
     ```
     - Leave this as default (should already say "Jenkinsfile")

4. **Optional Settings** (you can leave these):
   - Lightweight checkout: Unchecked (default)
   - Additional Behaviors: Leave default

### Step 5: Save Configuration
1. Scroll to the bottom
2. Click **"Save"** button

### Step 6: Test the Pipeline
1. You'll see the job page
2. In the left sidebar, click **"Build Now"**
3. You'll see build #1 appear in "Build History" (bottom left)
4. Click on the build number (#1)
5. Click **"Console Output"** (left sidebar)
6. **Watch it run!** You should see:
   ```
   Started by user [your-name]
   [Pipeline] Start of Pipeline
   [Pipeline] Checkout
   [Pipeline] stage
   [Pipeline] { (Checkout)
   [Pipeline] stage
